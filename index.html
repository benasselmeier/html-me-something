                <!-- Intro -->
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Having played all the games in the <em>Metroid</em> series, (many of them multiple times) I've developed a pretty extensive knowledge of the final bosses of each game. I might as well put that to good use here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few ground rules, however, before we begin:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                For bosses that appear multiple times, but in the same fashion, I'll be referencing their most recent appearance. An example of this is Mother Brain in the original game, and her reappearance in <em>Zero Mission.</em>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                I won't be including any &quot;post-game&quot; bosses, or bosses that appear after you've completed the main story. This means no Phantoon from <em>Metroid: Other M</em>, no Proteus Ridley from <em>Metroid: Samus Returns</em>, or no bosses who appear in similar manners to this.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Exception: <em>Metroid Fusion</em>, where the SA-X and Omega Metroid both appear as the game ends.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                               No spin-offs. This includes <em>Metroid Prime Pinball</em> and <em>Metroid Prime: Federation Force</em>. Federation Force was an abomination anyway.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Now that those are out of the way... let's get started.</p>
                </article>

                <!-- List -->
                <article>
                    <ol reversed>
                        <li>
                            <p><h2>Queen Metroid</h2></p>
                                <p><h4><em>Metroid: Other M</em></h4></p>
                                <p>
                                    For fans of the <em>Metroid</em > series, <em>Other M</em> was... very disappointing.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Unfortunately, the game's final boss is also a letdown.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In the Queen Metroid's first reappearance since 1991's <em>Return of Samus</em>, she doesn't really give the impression
                                    she's been itching to fight Samus for all those years. She doesn't even pay attention to Samus for the first half of the
                                    battle, instead sending her babies to attack for her. It's only after Samus has killed enough of them that she decides to
                                    pursue the Bounty Hunter herself... veeerrryyyy... sloooooowwwwwly.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Queen's too slow to pose a real threat, instead serving as more of a nuisance to Samus as she slowly chips away at the Queen,
                                    eventually ending the beast's life by heading down its throat as a Morph Ball and bombing her belly to death. However, <em>Other M's</em>
                                    attempts to make everything more cinematic than it needs to be ruins the experience.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's a <em>good</em> fight... but just good. Nothing more.
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><h2>Gorea</h2></p>
                                <p><h4><em>Metroid Prime: Hunters</em></h4></p>
                                <p>
                                    The final boss of <em>Hunters</em> was a pleasant surprise in a game where you previously fought the same two bosses four times each.
                                    Gorea absorbs the powers of the Hunters Samus encounters through the course of the game as she enters his chamber, thus gaining the ability
                                    to shield himself from all but a specific attack from Samus. It's a pretty generic battle system, but it's also not too dull to be boring.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    However, the most interesting part of the fight is that which occurs when Samus activates the relics on the walls of Gorea's chamber. Doing so causes the
                                    fight with Gorea to contain a second stage - in the lower chambers of the Oubliette (Gorea's chamber in which the Alimbics imprisoned him) lies
                                    the sealed Omega Cannon - a weapon the Alimbics called an abomination due to its power, and the &quot;ultimate power&quot; that the mystery transmission
                                    Samus receives at the start of the game is referring to.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    For a game that was an early title on the Nintendo DS, <em>Prime Hunters deserves a lot of credit for delivering a solid final boss fight.</em>
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><h2>Mother Brain</h2></p>
                                <p><h4><em>Metroid</em> and <em>Metroid: Zero Mission</em></h4></p>
                                <p>
                                    The first final boss in the series, Mother Brain's appearance in <em>Metroid</em> was unfortunately severely limited by the capabilities
                                    of the NES.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thankfully, the release of <em>Zero Mission</em> changed that entirely.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <em>Zero Mission</em> was my first <em>Metroid</em> game, and the one responsible for igniting my love of the series. The final battle with Mother Brain
                                    presented a perfect level of difficulty. Mother Brain herself wasn't the difficult part - the Rinkas and Cannons in her chamber were what made me want to
                                    pull my hair out. Trying to get a good shot at Mother Brain's glass enclosure wasn't easy while her underlings pelted Samus with attacks, constantly knocking
                                    her into the lava below.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Once the glass surrounding Mother Brain is broken, she'll begin attacking herself, unleashing beams from her eye with increasing frequency as Samus continues to attack her.
                                    This fight didn't present anything special in terms of strategies or events - but despite this, it was solid and never disappoints.
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><h2>Emperor Ing</h2></p>
                                <p><h4><em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em></h4></p>
                                <p>
                                    The Ing of <em>Echoes</em> were a bit creepy, and Emperor Ing is no exception. Appearing seemingly from thin air as Samus enters his Phazon-littered chamber,
                                    Emperor Ing immediately bombards Samus with swinging tentacles and energy beams, which are rapid and pretty difficult to get around if you're not expecting them.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Eventually, Emperor Ing enters a defensive chrysalis, forcing Samus to use the Spider Ball and bomb the weak points in his shell. After that's done, things get quiet.
                                    Then the Emperor reveals his true form.
                                    Emperor Ing's final form is fast, fierce, and hits hard, definitely living up to his title. After a long fight, Samus is able to take him down, and with him, the fabric of
                                    Dark Aether itself, prompting another of <em>Metroid</em>'s iconic escape sequences.
