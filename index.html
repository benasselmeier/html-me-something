                <!-- Intro -->
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Having played all the games in the <em>Metroid</em> series, (many of them multiple times) I've developed a pretty extensive knowledge of the final bosses of each game. I might as well put that to good use here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few ground rules, however, before we begin:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                For bosses that appear multiple times, but in the same fashion, I'll be referencing their most recent appearance. An example of this is Mother Brain in the original game, and her reappearance in <em>Zero Mission.</em>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                I won't be including any &quot;post-game&quot; bosses, or bosses that appear after you've completed the main story. This means no Phantoon from <em>Metroid: Other M</em>, no Proteus Ridley from <em>Metroid: Samus Returns</em>, or no bosses who appear in similar manners to this.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Exceptions: <em>Metroid Fusion</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em>, where two entirely separate final bosses appear as the game ends. I'll be including each of these under the same ranking.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                               No spin-offs. This includes <em>Metroid Prime Pinball</em> and <em>Metroid Prime: Federation Force</em>. Federation Force was an abomination anyway.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Now that those are out of the way... let's get started.</p>
                </article>

                        <li>
                            <p><h2>Queen Metroid</h2></p>
                                <div id="gametitle">
                                    <p><h4>Metroid: Other M</h4></p>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    For fans of the <em>Metroid</em > series, <em>Other M</em> was... very disappointing.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Unfortunately, the game's final boss is also a letdown.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In the Queen Metroid's first reappearance since 1991's <em>Return of Samus</em>, she doesn't really give the impression
                                    she's been itching to fight Samus for all those years. She doesn't even pay attention to Samus for the first half of the
                                    battle, instead sending her babies to attack for her. It's only after Samus has killed enough of them that she decides to
                                    pursue the Bounty Hunter herself... veeerrryyyy... sloooooowwwwwly.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Queen's too slow to pose a real threat, instead serving as more of a nuisance to Samus as she slowly chips away at the Queen,
                                    eventually ending the beast's life by heading down its throat as a Morph Ball and bombing her belly to death. However, <em>Other M's</em>
                                    attempts to make everything more cinematic than it needs to be ruins the experience.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's a <em>good</em> fight... but just good. Nothing more.
                                    <br>
                                    <div class="image">

                                        Samus prepares to fight the Queen Metroid in Metroid: Other M.
                                    </div>
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><h2>Gorea</h2></p>
                            <div id="gametitle">
                                <p><h4>Metroid Prime: Hunters</h4></p>
                            </div>
                                <p>
                                    The final boss of <em>Hunters</em> was a pleasant surprise in a game where you previously fought the same two bosses four times each.
                                    Gorea absorbs the powers of the Hunters Samus encounters through the course of the game as she enters its chamber, thus gaining the ability
                                    to shield itself from all but a specific attack from Samus. It's a pretty generic battle system, but it's also not too dull to be boring.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    However, the most interesting part of the fight is that which occurs when Samus activates the relics on the walls of Gorea's chamber. Doing so causes the
                                    fight with Gorea to contain a second stage - in the lower chambers of the Oubliette (the chamber in which the Alimbics imprisoned it) lies
                                    the sealed Omega Cannon - a weapon the Alimbics called an abomination due to its power, and the &quot;ultimate power&quot; that the mystery transmission
                                    Samus receives at the start of the game is referring to.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    For a game that was an early title on the Nintendo DS, <em>Prime Hunters</em> deserves a lot of credit for its ambitions on such a new system, as well as 
                                    for delivering a solid final boss fight.
                                    <br>

                        <li>
                                <p><h2>Mother Brain</h2></p>
                                    <div id="gametitle">
                                        <h4>Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission</h4></p>

                                    <p>
                                        The first final boss in the series, Mother Brain's appearance in <em>Metroid</em> was unfortunately severely limited by the capabilities
                                        of the NES.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Thankfully, the release of <em>Zero Mission</em> changed that entirely.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <em>Zero Mission</em> was my first <em>Metroid</em> game, and the one responsible for igniting my love of the series. The final battle with Mother Brain
                                        presented a perfect level of difficulty. Mother Brain herself wasn't the difficult part - the Rinkas and Cannons in her chamber were what made me want to
                                        pull my hair out. Trying to get a good shot at Mother Brain's glass enclosure wasn't easy while her underlings pelted Samus with attacks, constantly knocking
                                        her into the lava below.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Once the glass surrounding Mother Brain is broken, she'll begin attacking herself, unleashing beams from her eye with increasing frequency as Samus continues to attack her.
                                        This fight didn't present anything special in terms of strategies or events - but despite this, it was solid and never disappoints.

                                    One of the only two bosses on this list to appear as the final boss of two entirely separate games (the other being Mother Brain), the Queen from <em>Metroid 2</em>
                                    and its various remakes is also the only boss on this list to appear three times in the same setting. Pretty impressive! But perhaps what's more impressive is just
                                    how little her battle actually changed, a testament to how well it worked. <em>Metroid II</em> laid the foundation, <em>Samus Returns</em> refined it, while <em>AM2R</em>
                                    totally reinvented it.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The fight with the Queen in <em>Metroid II</em> and <em>AM2R</em> goes as you'd expect if you recall the Queen fight from <em>Other M</em> mentioned earlier. The Queen lunges at Samus and fires a variety of
                                    projectiles and missiles at her, but eventually Samus heads into the belly of the beast and destroys her from within with Power Bombs. However, in <em>Samus Returns</em>, that's gone - a bummer, for sure. 
                                    While not an extraordinary boss battle by any means, the simplicity of this fight combined with the satisfaction of getting the Queen's attack patterns down are enough to make it memorable.

                                    <em>Fusion</em> was a terrific game. Despite many fans' criticisms of its linear plot in comparison to previous titles, <em>Fusion</em> did something that no game in the 
                                    series had done before - horror.
                                    <br>

                                    Throughout the events of <em>Metroid Fusion</em>, Samus is constantly pursued by a rogue X-Parasite which has taken up residence in the removed components of her infected Power Suit.
                                    Named SA-X by Samus and her gunship computer, Adam, it's far too strong for Samus to battle, and, due to Samus being infused with Metroid DNA as a result of her X vaccination, she's
                                    extremely weak to the SA-X's arsenal of ice-equipped weaponry. The game is spent running from SA-X, ducking into dark hallways as you hear its footsteps creeping by you.
                                    Then, you encounter the SA-X on the Operations Deck, and there's nowhere to run. Samus has to fight her way out, eventually revealing the SA-X's true form - a hideous abomination
                                    made of creatures the X Parasites have absorbed. Samus defeats the SA-X, reducing it to its &quot;Core-X&quot; form, and flees as she sets the Biologic Space Laboratory on a collision
                                    course with Planet SR388, the home planet of the Metroids.

                                    As Samus makes her way to the dock of the Laboratory, she's met with another foe - an Omega Metroid. The final stage of evolution for Metroids who don't possess the Queen gene structure,
                                    Omega Metroids are exceptionally powerful, and much tougher of a foe for Samus than the SA-X - after all, she lacks a weapon that can exploit their true weakness - cold. The Omega Metroid
                                    nearly ends Samus, but the SA-X jumps in, pelting it with Ice Missiles, and eventually allowing Samus to absorb its energy, regain her true power, defeat the Metroid herself and escape as

                                    The Ing of <em>Echoes</em> were a bit creepy, and Emperor Ing is no exception. Appearing seemingly from thin air as Samus enters his Phazon-littered chamber,
                                    Emperor Ing immediately bombards Samus with swinging tentacles and energy beams, which are rapid and pretty difficult to get around if you're not expecting them.

                                    Eventually, Emperor Ing enters a defensive chrysalis, forcing Samus to use the Spider Ball and bomb the weak points in his shell. After that's done, things get quiet.
                                    Then the Emperor reveals his true form.
                                    Emperor Ing's final form is fast, fierce, and hits hard, definitely living up to his title. After a long fight, Samus is able to take him down, and with him, the fabric of
                                    Dark Aether itself, prompting another of <em>Metroid</em>'s iconic escape sequences.

                                    As soon as Samus leaves the Sky Temple that served as Emperor Ing's lair, the <strong>real</strong> fun begins. Dark Samus appears once more, but something's different this time around - she's basically a skeleton,
                                    so starved of Phazon exposure that she's almost become ethereal. Samus and her Dark Samus do battle as the entire planet of Dark Aether collapses around them, with the former dodging countless beams of
                                    concentrated Phazon and explosions from the latter as they clash. Eventually, Samus overtakes her nemesis, resulting in yet another Dark Samus retreat... but I've got a feeling she'll be back.

                                    Now we're getting to the really good stuff. <em>Prime</em> was <em>Metroid</em>'s first appearance in 3D, and ended up taking a place as one of the most beloved games of all time - it isn't difficult to see why.
                                    Samus's exploration of planet Tallon IV is just as eye-opening as it is jaw-dropping - a giant meteor hit the planet, the Chozo are dead and their ghosts haunt the surface of the planet, and the Space Pirates are
                                    harvesting the strange substance that's seeping from the meteor's impact site - Phazon. Samus makes her way through the planet's caverns and Pirate strongholds, and then comes face to face with the guardian of the
                                    impact crater, Metroid Prime herself.

                                    Metroid Prime is a plain 'ol Metroid that mutated into a gigantic beast due to Phazon exposure, and she's <strong>pissed</strong> that Samus is after her. Metroid Prime, similar to Gorea from earlier in the list,
                                    forces Samus to attack with specific weaponry as she changes her defenses. Samus must dodge charges and beams by navigating under Metroid Prime with the Morph Ball, and each stage of the fight takes you deeper into
                                    the crater. Eventually, Metroid Prime falls down to the bottom of the crater, and Samus pursues.

                                    Upon landing, Samus discovers that Metroid Prime has abandoned her physical shell, opting to make a final stand in her true form. She barrages Samus with Phazon and mutated Metroid larvae, becomes invisible and forces
                                    Samus to use her X-Ray and Thermal Visors just to maintain her vision. It's only by using the Phazon Suit to augment her strength that Samus is able to damage and eventually defeat Metroid Prime, however, as the creature
                                    dies, it latches onto Samus, stealing away the Phazon-enhanced components of her power suit. Samus flees the impact crater and Tallon IV, but under the surface, Metroid Prime uses the stolen Phazon Suit as a means of
                                    rebirth, coming back to life as the infamous Dark Samus.

                                    <em>Corruption</em>'s final fight with Dark Samus has a terrific setup - after all, it's basically the culmination of the game as well as its two predecessors. After losing three of her close allies - Rundas, Ghor, and
                                    Gandrayda - to Dark Samus, she heads to Phaaze for a final showdown with her dark doppelganger. The battle is long, tedious, and complex. Dark Samus unleashes tons of attacks, clones herself, recharges her energy with
                                    the planet's atmosphere, turns invisible... you name it, Dark Samus will try it. Once she's had enough, she calls in a friend.

                                    Earlier in the game, Dark Samus stole an &quot;Aurora Unit&quot; number 313, from the Galactic Federation. The Aurora Units are essentially biomechanical supercomputers that serve as the Galactic Federation's
                                    command centers. For Dark Samus, 313 became the command center of Phaaze - coordinating the efforts to spread Phazon as far across the galaxy as possible.

                                    and exposing its weak point for her to attack. Eventually, the head separates entirely. Samus delivers the final blow, destroying 313, Dark Samus, and all Phazon, including that which had infected her body.

                                    across gaming as a whole. Samus's showdown with Mother Brain in <em>Super Metroid</em> combined with the narrative leading up to it are incredible when you consider the time in which they were created.
                                    Not a lot was expected from video games back in 1994, and there was no way in hell people could have expected something like this.

                                    attacks, before finally unleashing her deadly Laser Brain attack (creative name, I know, right?) and leaving Samus with one final breath before finishing her off. As Mother Brain charges up her final blow, the baby Metroid
                                    that Samus saved earlier absorbs the blow, instead using the energy to replenish Samus's energy and grant her a superpower of a weapon: the Hyper Beam.
