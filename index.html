                <p><h4>Might as well put my nerd side to good use here.</h4></p>

                <!-- Intro -->
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Having played all the games in the <em>Metroid</em> series, (many of them multiple times) I've developed a pretty extensive knowledge of the final bosses of each game. I might as well put that to good use here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few ground rules, however, before we begin:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                For bosses that appear multiple times, but in the same fashion, I'll be referencing their most recent appearance. An example of this is Mother Brain in the original game, and her reappearance in <em>Zero Mission.</em>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                I won't be including any &quot;post-game&quot; bosses, or bosses that appear after you've completed the main story. This means no Phantoon from <em>Metroid: Other M</em>, no Proteus Ridley from <em>Metroid: Samus Returns</em>, or no bosses who appear in similar manners to this.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Exceptions: <em>Metroid Fusion</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em>, where two entirely separate final bosses appear as the game ends. I'll be including each of these under the same ranking.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                               No spin-offs. This includes <em>Metroid Prime Pinball</em> and <em>Metroid Prime: Federation Force</em>. Federation Force was an abomination anyway.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Now that those are out of the way... let's get started.</p>
                </article>

                        <li>
                            <p><h2>Queen Metroid</h2></p>
                                <p><h4><em>Metroid: Other M</em></h4></p>
                                <p>
                                    For fans of the <em>Metroid</em > series, <em>Other M</em> was... very disappointing.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Unfortunately, the game's final boss is also a letdown.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In the Queen Metroid's first reappearance since 1991's <em>Return of Samus</em>, she doesn't really give the impression
                                    she's been itching to fight Samus for all those years. She doesn't even pay attention to Samus for the first half of the
                                    battle, instead sending her babies to attack for her. It's only after Samus has killed enough of them that she decides to
                                    pursue the Bounty Hunter herself... veeerrryyyy... sloooooowwwwwly.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Queen's too slow to pose a real threat, instead serving as more of a nuisance to Samus as she slowly chips away at the Queen,
                                    eventually ending the beast's life by heading down its throat as a Morph Ball and bombing her belly to death. However, <em>Other M's</em>
                                    attempts to make everything more cinematic than it needs to be ruins the experience.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's a <em>good</em> fight... but just good. Nothing more.
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><h2>Gorea</h2></p>
                                <p><h4><em>Metroid Prime: Hunters</em></h4></p>
                                <p>
                                    The final boss of <em>Hunters</em> was a pleasant surprise in a game where you previously fought the same two bosses four times each.
                                    Gorea absorbs the powers of the Hunters Samus encounters through the course of the game as she enters his chamber, thus gaining the ability
                                    to shield himself from all but a specific attack from Samus. It's a pretty generic battle system, but it's also not too dull to be boring.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    However, the most interesting part of the fight is that which occurs when Samus activates the relics on the walls of Gorea's chamber. Doing so causes the
                                    fight with Gorea to contain a second stage - in the lower chambers of the Oubliette (Gorea's chamber in which the Alimbics imprisoned him) lies
                                    the sealed Omega Cannon - a weapon the Alimbics called an abomination due to its power, and the &quot;ultimate power&quot; that the mystery transmission
                                    Samus receives at the start of the game is referring to.

                                    For a game that was an early title on the Nintendo DS, <em>Prime Hunters deserves a lot of credit for delivering a solid final boss fight.</em>
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><h2>SA-X/Omega Metroid</h2></p>
                                <p><h4><em>Metroid Fusion</em></h4></p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>Fusion</em> was a terrific game. Despite many fans' criticisms of its linear plot in comparison to previous titles, <em>Fusion</em> did something that no game in the 
                                    series had done before - horror.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    ...and hot damn, did it do it well.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Throughout the events of <em>Metroid Fusion</em>, Samus is constantly pursued by a rogue X-Parasite which has taken up residence in the removed components of her infected Power Suit.
                                    Named SA-X by Samus and her gunship computer, Adam, it's far too strong for Samus to battle, and, due to Samus being infused with Metroid DNA as a result of her X vaccination, she's
                                    extremely weak to the SA-X's arsenal of ice-equipped weaponry. The game is spent running from SA-X, ducking into dark hallways as you hear its footsteps creeping by you.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Then, you encounter the SA-X on the Operations Deck, and there's nowhere to run. Samus has to fight her way out, eventually revealing the SA-X's true form - a hideous abomination
                                    made of creatures the X Parasites have absorbed. Samus defeats the SA-X, reducing it to its &quot;Core-X&quot; form, and flees as she sets the Biologic Space Laboratory on a collision
                                    course with Planet SR388, the home planet of the Metroids.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    As Samus makes her way to the dock of the Laboratory, she's met with another foe - an Omega Metroid. The final stage of evolution for Metroids who don't possess the Queen gene structure,
                                    Omega Metroids are exceptionally powerful, and much tougher of a foe for Samus than the SA-X - after all, she lacks a weapon that can exploit their true weakness - cold. The Omega Metroid
                                    nearly ends Samus, but the SA-X jumps in, pelting it with Ice Missiles, and eventually allowing Samus to absorb its energy, regain her true power, defeat the Metroid herself and escape as
                                    the laboratory meets the surface of SR388.

                                    <em>Fusion</em>'s ending may not have induced the adrenaline rush that the other endings in the series have induced, but for the series' first foray into a true horror genre, it ended
                                    in a way that was both fitting and deserving of the game.

                            <p><h2>Mother Brain</h2></p>
                                <p><h4><em>Metroid</em> and <em>Metroid: Zero Mission</em></h4></p>
                                <p>
                                    The first final boss in the series, Mother Brain's appearance in <em>Metroid</em> was unfortunately severely limited by the capabilities
                                    of the NES.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thankfully, the release of <em>Zero Mission</em> changed that entirely.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <em>Zero Mission</em> was my first <em>Metroid</em> game, and the one responsible for igniting my love of the series. The final battle with Mother Brain
                                    presented a perfect level of difficulty. Mother Brain herself wasn't the difficult part - the Rinkas and Cannons in her chamber were what made me want to
                                    pull my hair out. Trying to get a good shot at Mother Brain's glass enclosure wasn't easy while her underlings pelted Samus with attacks, constantly knocking
                                    her into the lava below.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Once the glass surrounding Mother Brain is broken, she'll begin attacking herself, unleashing beams from her eye with increasing frequency as Samus continues to attack her.
                                    This fight didn't present anything special in terms of strategies or events - but despite this, it was solid and never disappoints.
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><h2>Queen Metroid</h2></p>
                                <p><h4><em>Metroid 2: Return of Samus</em>, <em>AM2R</em>, and <em>Metroid: Samus Returns</em></h4></p>
                                <p>
                                    One of the only two bosses on this list to appear as the final boss of two entirely separate games (the other being Mother Brain), the Queen from <em>Metroid 2</em>
                                    and its various remakes is also the only boss on this list to appear three times in the same setting. Pretty impressive! But perhaps what's more impressive is just
                                    how little her battle actually changed, a testament to how well it worked. <em>Metroid II</em> laid the foundation, <em>Samus Returns</em> refined it, while <em>AM2R</em>
                                    totally reinvented it.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The fight with the Queen goes as you'd expect if you recall the Queen fight from <em>Other M</em> mentioned earlier. The Queen lunges at Samus and fires a variety of
                                    projectiles and missiles at her, but eventually Samus heads into the belly of the beast and destroys her from within with Power Bombs. While not an extraordinary boss
                                    battle by any means, the simplicity of this fight combined with the satisfaction of getting the Queen's attack patterns down land it in the middle of the list.
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><h2>Emperor Ing/Dark Samus</h2></p>
                                <p><h4><em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em></h4></p>
                                <p>
                                    The Ing of <em>Echoes</em> were a bit creepy, and Emperor Ing is no exception. Appearing seemingly from thin air as Samus enters his Phazon-littered chamber,
                                    Emperor Ing immediately bombards Samus with swinging tentacles and energy beams, which are rapid and pretty difficult to get around if you're not expecting them.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Eventually, Emperor Ing enters a defensive chrysalis, forcing Samus to use the Spider Ball and bomb the weak points in his shell. After that's done, things get quiet.
                                    Then the Emperor reveals his true form.
                                    Emperor Ing's final form is fast, fierce, and hits hard, definitely living up to his title. After a long fight, Samus is able to take him down, and with him, the fabric of
                                    Dark Aether itself, prompting another of <em>Metroid</em>'s iconic escape sequences.

                                    <br>
                                    As soon as Samus leaves the Sky Temple that served as Emperor Ing's lair, the <strong>real</strong> fun begins. Dark Samus appears once more, but something's different this time around - she's basically a skeleton,
                                    so heavily mutated by Phazon exposure that she's almost ethereal. Samus and her dark doppelganger do battle as the entire planet of Dark Aether collapses around them. Eventually, Samus overtakes her nemesis, resulting
                                    in yet another Dark Samus retreat.
